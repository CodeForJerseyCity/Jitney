<p>Bayonne- Jersey City</p>

<p>This route runs between 5th Street in Bayonne and Journal Square in Jersey City via Kennedy Boulevard / J.F.K Boulevard West.</p>

<p>Jitney run on this route approximately every 20 minutes. This route is also covered by NJ Transit routes 10 and 119.  The number 10 also runs every 20 minutes.</p>

<p>At Journal Square, southbound Bayonne jitneys can be boarded on JFK Boulevard, just west of Bergenline Avenue.</p>

<p>Some jitneys on this route may not have proper signs.  This route does not overlap with any other jitney routes, so if you see a jitney bus on JFK Boulevard south of Journal Square, you can be sure it is on the Bayonne – Journal Square route.</p>

<p>They run every 2-4 minutes during rush hours, and somewhat less frequently at other times.</p>

<p>Look for buses with signs that read “New York 42nd Street.”</p>

<p>In New York, buses on this route board on the north side of the Port Authority, on the south side of 42nd Street just west of 8th Avenue.</p>

<p>In Union City, West New York, and North Bergen, this route overlaps with the  Newport Mall – Journal Square – Bergenline – George Washington Bridge route.</p>

<p>Jersey City – Union City – West New York – Guttenberg – North Bergen – Fairview – Cliffside Park – Fort Lee – New York</p>

<p>In New York, buses board on the lower level of the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, from which they run south to Journal Square, and then east to the Newport Mall in downtown Jersey City.</p>

<p>The route has several variations.  Southbound, buses operate on Anderson Avenue and Bergenline.  Northbound, they run on New York Avenue in Jersey City Heights until 48th Street, and then on Bergenline, Anderson, and Center Street in Fort Lee.</p>

<p>Buses use various different routes to reach Journal Square.  Also, they branch into two different routes at Newport Mall.  Some jitneys loop around the mall to Washington Boulevard, and the rest terminate at 10th Street and Manila Ave.</p>

<p>Many jitneys also turn around at Bridge Plaza in Fort Lee without crossing the bridge.</p>

<p>Buses run approximately every 1 to 2 minutes during the day, so you will almost never have to wait.</p>

<p>Fares are between $2 and $5.</p>

<p>Buses will have signs that read “Bergenline Journal Square” or just “Bergenline,” with a list of towns in small print.  See the photo above. However, multiple different companies operate this route, so not all buses will have the same signage. If in doubt, ask the driver.

<p>North Bergen – Guttenberg – West New York- Weehawken – New York</p>

<p>Boulevard East jitneys run from Midtown Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel and along JFK Boulevard East through Weehawken, West New York, Guttenberg, and North Bergen. Jitneys terminate at Nungessers (intersection of Bergeline Avenue, JFK Boulevards East and West, and Woodcliff Avenue) in North Bergen, which is a transfer point to other jitney routes.
</p>

<p>In Union City, some jitneys exit the Lincoln Tunnel approach directly onto Boulevard East, and others operate via Park Avenue and Highwood Terrace.</p>

<p>In New York, buses board on the north side of 42nd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues, across the street from the Port Authority.</p>

<p>Buses run approximately every 4 minutes during rush hours and every 5 minutes in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>These buses run on a similar route to NJ Transit routes 128, 159, 166, and 168, which all run frequently to the Port Authority.</p>

<p>Fares are between $2 and $5.</p>

<p>Multiple different companies operate this route, so not all buses will have the same signage. In general, signs will say “New York Boulevard East” (see above). If in doubt, ask the driver.</p>

<p>Some jitneys on the Bergenline Avenue route branch off at Nungessers and travel through Fairview, Ridgefield, and Palisades Park.  However, they only operate erratically on this route.  The part of this route north of Nungessers is shared with NJ Transit routes 165 and 166.</p>

<p>Since this route is operated by Bergenline Avenue jitneys, the vehicles have the same “Bergenline” signs as others on that route.</p>

<p>Drivers mainly use this route to get to their garages, which explains the route’s part-time nature.</p>

<p>Jitneys run along Kennedy Boulevard, also known as J.F.K. Boulevard West, between Journal Square and Nungessers, both of which are transfer points to other jitney lines.</p>

<p>This route operates about every ten minutes on weekdays and every 15-20 on weekends, and runs on the same route as NJ Transit number 88, which runs every 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Look for buses with signs that read “Kennedy Blvd.”  or “Kennedy Journal Square.”</p>

<p>Between Journal Square and 30th Street in Union City, this route overlaps with the Kennedy Blvd. – Port Authority jitney route.</p>

<p>At Journal Square, Kennedy Boulevard jitneys can be boarded on the northbound side of Kennedy Boulevard, outside the Journal Square Transportation Center.</p>

<p> This route is different from other Jitney routes in northern New Jersey.  It runs on a published schedule and is operated by a company called Tourline Travel and Tour.  It also only accepts passengers at a few stops.</p>

<p>The company charges fares of $10 and the total trip takes about 40 minutes.</p>

<p>While this service is provided mainly to connect Korean neighborhoods in Palisades Park, Fort Lee, and Queens, it is completely open to the public.</p>

<p>See the company’s website here (in Korean).  The schedule, which shows Downtown Flushing in the first column, 150th Street and 35th Avenue in the second, Fort Lee in the third and Palisades Park in the fourth, only shows departure times, and not arrival times.</p>

<p>On the New Jersey side, the route stops at the George Washington Bridge bus stop in Fort Lee and an office building called Pine Plaza at the corner of Broad Avenue and Harriet Avenue in Palisades Park.</p>
