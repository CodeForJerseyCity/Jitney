JERSEY CITY JITNEY MAP APP
==========================

A project submitted by our team during Spring 2014's National Day of Civic Hacking. Visit [http://hackforchange.org/](http://hackforchange.org/) for more info.

Project Background
------------------
Jitney's are an important public transportation option for many communities in Jersey City and Hudson County. This project replaced static jitney maps found here: [http://www.jerseyjitneys.info/?page_id=7](http://www.jerseyjitneys.info/?page_id=7), with a responsive app. 

The next steps would be to add support for Spanish language to the app and create a crowdsourcing platform where the jitney routes can be tracked and reported by the passengers.
